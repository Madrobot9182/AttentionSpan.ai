NatHack 2025 - Real time brainwave monitoring and fatigue detectionin 

## Focus Garden 🌱

Our AI model monitors your mental state in real-time across four categories:

- **Not Fatigued & Focused**
- **Fatigued & Focused**
- **Fatigued & Not Focused**
- **Not Fatigued & Not Focused**

### How It Works
During each session, your **focus level** determines how many **coins** you earn.  
The longer you stay focused, the more coins you collect.

You can then use these coins to **sell or upgrade your plants**, purchasing better ones that generate **higher base earnings** each session.

Stay focused, grow your garden, and watch your productivity bloom! 🌼
